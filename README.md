# PittStop26
Hacklytics 2026 Project

This project is designed to provide clear, data-driven analysis of how a politician’s proposed financial policies could impact their local economy. By examining factors such as taxation changes, public spending plans, small business incentives, infrastructure investment, and budget allocations, the platform models potential effects on job growth, household income, cost of living, and long-term economic stability within a specific region. Using accessible visual dashboards, comparative reports, and plain-language summaries, the site helps users understand both short-term and long-term economic implications. Its goal is to equip voters with objective, research-based insights so they can make more informed decisions based on how policy proposals may shape their community’s economic future.
