<!-- Strategy -->
<div id="strategy">
    <h2>Kemp's Investment Plan</h2>
        <p>Kemp plans to improve investment using these strategies:</p>
    <h2>1. Lower Taxes for Businesses</h2>
    <p>
        Kemp has proposed lowering taxes for businesses to encourage investment and economic growth in Atlanta. By reducing the tax burden on companies, he aims to 
        attract new businesses to the city and support the expansion of existing ones. This strategy is intended to create a more favorable business environment, 
        stimulate job creation, and increase overall economic activity in the region. However, critics argue that lowering taxes may reduce government revenue, 
        which could impact public services and infrastructure funding. The effectiveness of this strategy will depend on how well it balances the need for economic 
        growth with the city's fiscal responsibilities.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Infrastructure Improvement Programs</h2>
    <p>
        Kemp has also focused on improving infrastructure in Atlanta to attract investment and support economic growth. By investing in transportation, utilities, and public facilities, 
        the city aims to create a more attractive environment for businesses and investors. Improved infrastructure can enhance productivity, reduce operational costs, and increase the overall 
        competitiveness of the city. This strategy is expected to complement other investment initiatives and contribute to long-term economic development in Atlanta.
